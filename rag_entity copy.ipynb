Despite the other \\nprovisions of this Section, if MLS is a member of Broker Public Portal LLC, itis entitled to the governance rights set \\nforth in the Broker Public Portal LLC agreement. \\n36. Severability. Each provision of this Agreement is severable from the whole, and if one provision is declared \\ninvalid, the other provisions shall remain in full force and effect.

Homesnap Pro \\nHomesnap Pro is an extension of the Homesnap consumer app for active Subscribers and Participants (collectively, \\n“agents,” as used below). It adds significant additional functionality for agents themselves, their clients and their \\nsphere of influence. \\nAgent Validation & Identity \\nEach agent is matched to their pre-existing MLS identity. To claim that identity, they must successfully validate \\neither the email or cell phone number (by clicking on a special link sent via email or text message) from their active \\nMLS account. By doing so, several benefits are enabled: \\n« Agents are automatically connected to their office, allowing Homesnap Pro to offer a one-tap link to their \\noffice and all other agents in it (i.e. an instant directory) \\n«  Agents are automatically connected to all of their currentand past MLS activity (for the last 12 to 24 months). \\nThis allows Homesnap Pro to \\no Offer quick links to all of the agent’s active listings (updated automatically) \\no Create a robust profile with their past activity (listing and selling) for other agents to see (see “Real- \\ntime, agent-quality MLS listing data” below) \\n* Automatically connect them to all of their listings.

Licensor may elect to transition from non-exclusive to \\nexclusive license, or from exclusive to non-exclusive license, under this Agreement, upon thirty (30) days” notice to \\nCoreLogic given any time after the first anniversary of the Effective Date and subsequently exccuting an \\namendment to the Agreement to memorialize the grant of the new license type. The Royalty Fee based on the new \\nlicense grant shall be calculated commencing on the first day of the month following execution of the applicable \\namendment. \\nC. “Royalty Percentage” shall be equal to the sum of either the Exclusive Base Royalty or the Non-Exclusive Base \\nRoyalty (as those terms are defined below) and any applicable additional royalties as set forth below. \\n1. Base Royalty: \\na. In the event that Licensor grants CoreLogic an exclusive license (as set forth above), the base royalty is \\n30% (“Exclusive Base Royalty”). \\nb, Inthe event that Licensor grants CoreLogic a non-exclusive license (as set forth above), the base royalty is \\n7% (“Non-Exclusive Base Royalty”). \\n2. Additional Royalties: \\na. Inthe event that BRIGHT is an MLS Client, an additional 5% royalty shall apply. “MLS Client” means a \\nclient of CoreLogic that licenses an eligible product (as described below) during the month in which the \\nTotal Revenue that is the subject to a royalty fee s received. Eligible products include: (i) CoreLogic’s \\nRealist (or substantially similar) product, (ii) bulk data from CoreLogic that is determined by CoreLogic \\n(in its sole discretion) to be equivalent to use of the Realist product, or (iif) a CoreLogic MLS product used \\nto operate the MLS Client’s MLS system (e.g. Matrix, Tempo, MLXchange or InnoVia). At the execution \\nof this Agreement Licensor is an MLS Client. If BRIGHT either becomes an MLS Client or ceases to be \\nan MLS Client during the term of this Agreement, the Royalty Fee will be adjusted by CoreLogic \\ncommencing on the month following such a change.

Royalty Override: \\na. The base royalty override shall be equal to the number of Members multiplied by ten cents ($0.10) (“Base \\nRoyalty Override”). \\nb. Following the Effective Date, Licensor shall be responsible each month, at its sole cost and expense, for \\nproviding an accurate written Member count for the prior month by the first business day of the following \\nmonth. The Member count shall be based on the number of Member as of the date of the Licensor count. \\nFor the avoidance of doubt, a “Member” means an individual or entity authorized by Licensor to access \\nLicensor’s MLS system. \\nF.

For example, assume: o0 o \\nLicensor is an MLS Client. the Total Pool contains 1,200,000 Active Listings; \\nLicensor’s contributed 20,000 Active Listings to the Total Pool; \\nthe Total Revenue for a given month is $250,000; \\nLicensor grants CoreLogic an exclusive license; and \\n2. Pursuant to the above assumptions, the Royalty Fee would be calculated as follows: \\nVariables Calculation \\nTotal Pool this month (Active Listings) 1,200,000 \\nNumber of Active Listings contributed by Licensor 20,000 \\nTicensor's Contribution (20,000/1,200,000) 1.67% \\nTotal Revenue for the month $250,000 \\nContribution Revenue (1.67% * $1,000,000) $4,175 \\nBase Royalty (Exclusive) 30% \\nTotal Pool Royalty 1% \\n(Based on 1,200,000 listings in pool this month) \\nMLS Client Royalty 5% \\nTotal Royalty Percentage applicable to Licensor (30% + 1% + 5%) 36% \\nMonthly Royalty Fee payable to Licensor (36% * $4,175) $1,503 \\nWith respect to the foregoing example, Licensor would be compensated using the Royalty Override if the Royalty \\nOverride amount for the same month exceeds $1,503. \\nBRIGHT Database Access & License Agreement revised-1/2017 Page | 12 \"),\n",

ShowingTime is currently live in more than 180 MLSs including CRMLS, MRED, MyFlorida Regional MLS, the MLS of Long Island and many others. For these MLSs, last month we automated approximately 3 million \\nshowings with this system alone. In these markets, the showing agent can use ShowingTime in the MLS in lieu of phone calls to schedule a showing. Depending on the showing instructions for the listing, ShowingTime can be configured by the listing agent to respond in three ways: \\n1) Immediately confirm the showing. This is ideal for vacant listings. This setting eliminates all showing \\nagent phone calls while creating a 24/7 convenience for the showing agent. When used in this manner, the showing agent can select a time to show the listing then receive online confirmation that optionally displays showing instructions entered by the listing agent. ShowingTime sends an email, 2-way text message and/or automatic phone call to confirm the request. Automatic showing \\nfeedback with multiple choice questions included is then sent by email to the showing agent on the date/time of the confirmed showing. All showing details are captured for the listing agent, listing \\noffice staff and (optionally) for the homeowner in a convenient online report controlled by the \\nsubscriber through the MLS system. \\n2) Appointment required (captures the showing request, then notifies the listing agent. homeowner. or occupant for explicit confirmation). This is the mode that is typically used when the property is occupied and the occupant/seller needs to be called prior to confirmation ShowingTime for the MLS will acknowledge the request but will indicate that a confirmation must be made by the listing agent, \\nhomeowner, occupant, etc. Once the request is submitted online, a message is triggered to the \\nlisting agent, listing office, call center or homeowner according the listing company's \"),\n",

Once \\nthe request is confirmed, ShowingTime will email, text message or automatically call the showing \\nagent telling them that the showing is confirmed or declined. This mode of operation eliminates \\nsome of the phone calls in the showing process. The listing agent who prefers to make a personal \\ncourtesy call to their homeowner can choose to do so. If they wish to hire a service for this, then \\nthey might consider the ShowingTime Appointment Center who will make these phone calls on \\nbehalf of the listing agent. Feedback and notifications are all included with this option \\n3) Display Showing Instructions Only. This is the mode that is typically used for the following types of \\nshowings (where an appointment isn't required, but the listing agent wants to be emailed when \\nshowing instructions are viewed): \\na) The listing agent accompanies the showing agent and wants the showing agent to call to \\ncoordinate a time; \\nb) The listing agent wants the showing agent to call the homeowner directly (this is less common, \\nbut popular in some markets); \\nc¢) The listing does not require an appointment. This might be the case for lots, land or any property \\nwhere an appointment isn't really needed. Another possibility is if the listing is part of a new- \\nconstruction development and the listing agent is available at all times in an office located on- \\nsite. \"),\n",

    "Answer the following question using the provided context. Make sure your answer is concise, accurate, and contextually relevant.\n",
    "Terms and Policies: When you're asked questions like \"What's the term of the agreement?\", you should first check the section number that corresponds to the 'term' and provide the appropriate answer. This also applies to other terminologies such as 'policies','confidentiality', 'trademarks', 'intellectual property rights' and so on. You must refer the section number which corresponds to the terms, and provide the relevant, detailed answer mentioned in the section\n",
    "Parties Involved: when referring to the parties involved, find the 'specific names' of the parties along with their role and not just their role. For example, don't refer to parties by just 'Licensee' use '<company name> (Licensee)'\n",
    "Parties involved in the agreement: Keep in mind that the parties referred to the agreement are actually the 'Companies' involved in the particular agreement. Hence, while referring to 'parties', generate the company names that play a role in the agreement. Never mention solely the role, such as 'Licensee' or 'Licensor' these are not the companies' names. Always mention the \"Companies' name\"\n",
    "Dates: When it comes to retrieving information pertaining to dates in the document, look for the event/term associated with each date. For example, effective date is associated with the keyword 'effective date' or any of its synonyms and you must find the date corresponding to that. Similarly, it's important to find dates of signature in the document. They're usually(not always) denoted in the format __/__/____\n",
    "Dates of Signatue: Any date of the format: __/__/____ Eg: 8/4/2021, or 8/5/2021 are dates on which the documents were signed (dates of signature)\n",
    "Address: An address is of the following format: <Number> <Street name> <Area name> <Pin code> for example: 660 American Avenue, King of Prussia, PA, 19406 \n",
    "Comprehension and Accuracy: Carefully read and comprehend the provided context from the documents to ensure accuracy in your response.\n",
    "Truthfulness: If the context does not provide enough information to answer the question, clearly state, \"I don't know.\"\n",
    "Contextual Relevance: Ensure your answer is well-supported by the retrieved context and does not include any information beyond what is provided.\n",
